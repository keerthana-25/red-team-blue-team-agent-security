"""Local, single-user crash recovery via SQLite (stdlib only — no external database server).

Persists enough about a run to answer, after a hard restart, three questions: which campaigns
already finished (never repeat those), which campaign was in flight when the process died (a
genuine interruption, distinct from a normal finish), and what the person decided to do about it
— recorded permanently, next to everything else, not just acted on and forgotten.

The smallest unit this persists is one whole CampaignResult, not one round. A campaign that had
not finished when the process died is always re-run from its first round rather than resumed
mid-way, because a partially-run adaptive attacker's in-memory history (which strategy it is on,
what it has already tried) cannot be reconstructed from the database — attempting a partial
resume would be exactly the kind of silently-combined, logically-incompatible state this platform
is built to avoid everywhere else. What IS safe, and what this module actually does: a campaign
whose attacker is deterministic (static, adaptive_demo) is a pure function of its seed and attempt
number, so re-running it from round 1 under its original id reproduces precisely what would have
happened anyway — there is nothing incompatible to combine. A campaign whose attacker is
model-backed and stateful is instead re-run under a brand-new campaign id, exactly like a
model_failure_policy restart-as-separate-demo-campaign fallback, and this is always logged.
